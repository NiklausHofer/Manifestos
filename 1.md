# 1. Manifest to disable communication with servers that have untrusted certificates

In the past, the certificates were worth the money. In the past, obtaining certificates was a difficult task.This forced the use of self-signed certificates in self-signed connections to preserve the federation.

Currently, certificates have become free and anyone can get them. We believe that the time has come to stop supporting self-signed certificates to increase user security.

Default settings Ejabberd and Prosody allow self-signed certificates:

**Ejabberd:**
```
s2s_use_starttls: required

```
**Prosody**
```
s2s_secure_auth = false
```
We intend to stop using untrusted certificates! [Manual for operators XMPP servers](https://github.com/E-404/Manifestos/blob/master/1.md#setup-instructions)


## Servers in this list pledge not to accept connections with self-signed certificates.

+ [404.city](https://404.city)
+ [xmpp.is](https://xmpp.is)
  + xmpp.co
  + xmpp.cx
  + xmpp.xyz
  + xmpp.fi
  + xmpp.si  
+ [jabber.at](https://jabber.at)
+ [os.vu](https://os.vu)




## Servers in this list refused to support the manifest

Servers that fail to verify certificates in cross-server connections

* xmpp.honet.ch
* [jabber.chaostreffbern.ch](https://chaostreffbern.ch/en/jabber.html)
  * jabber.chaosbern.ch
  * jabber.chaostreff-bern.ch

## Servers violated the execution of the manifest

Servers that accepted the manifest, but did not use it


## Setup Instructions


### Warning! 
Many administrators are trying to upgrade the certificate class by manually listing the ciphers - this is wrong. **Leave the defaults s2s list ciphers alone**. To upgrade the certificate class, **use the ECC certificate** instead of RSA, and not guessing with cipher list!


**Correct default (example for Ejabberd):**
```
'TLS_CIPHERS': "HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!3DES:@STRENGTH"
```
**Wrong modification: (example for Ejabberd)**
 ```
 'TLS_CIPHERS': "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CAMELLIA256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA"

```
This set includes **ECC (ECDHE-ECDSA) and RSA (ECDHE-RSA)** ciphers.If you do not include the ciphers in the ECC, you will lose contact with the ECC servers. If you do not enable RSA ciphers, you will lose connection with RSA servers. 

This is config right now, but will not work in the future! In the future, new ciphers will appear and the setting will be incorrect. 

### Configuration

**Ejabberd (ejabberd.yml)**
```
s2s_use_starttls: required
```
Change to
```
s2s_use_starttls: required_trusted
```
delete:
```
mod_s2s_dialback: {}
```
**Prosody**

```
s2s_secure_auth = false
```
Change to
```
s2s_secure_auth = true
```
